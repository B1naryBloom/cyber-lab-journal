# Cyber Journal Entry - August 6

- I got a chance to do shadow Noah during a websockets penetration test with an app that uses Blazor. 

- I saw just how many requests needed to be forwarded during that test as well. 

- It would be a bit difficult to see what is vulnerable because there was a CfDJ8 Serialization, however he did take the end of the serialization and place a payload at the end of the serialization and sent it to the intruder to run a few attacks. 

- After that he sent it to the comparer to analyze the differences.

- I need to research more about websockets, Bamba, web assembly, coding in java, ASP.NET. 

- use archive.org in a pentest to help you view a websites history and find potential vulnerabilites.

- Utilizing filters in Burp Suite, is a game changer! 

- Also, I completed the API unused API endpoint lab in the Web Security Academy and a huge write up on it. I hate that it took me so long and that I ran around the solution multiple times but I'm happy I realized where I went wrong with the lab and also I have a lessons learned section.
