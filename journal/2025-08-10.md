- Completed a few API labs today, and focused on timing.
- Over the weekend, I recognized how long it takes me to finish a lab so I give myself a 20min limit to see if I can complete the lab, if not I move on to a hint from the solution. If I can not solve the lab I use the entire solution. I think this will help me maximize my learning. I did that with the last two labs but I feel like there was another way to get the solution on the last API lab I completed, I was just too drained to continue. However, the solution was different from the way that I ALMOST completed it. I just needed a valid csrf token.
- So my goal is to try to complete those labs again sometime this week, and then complete a writeup on them. This time I am on the SQL Web Security Academy labs.
