- Classes start in *6 days!*, so I want to ensure that I can still consistently self study and complete labs. I am almost finished with part 1 of my CCNA OCG Vol. 1, and today after reading chapter 3, I will focus on labs for the remainder of the day.
- I will be sure to complete the end of chapter review for both chapter 2, and 3, to access what I've retained and what I need to refresh.
- I want to get my hands in automation, I found the "Automate the boring stuff with python" video series and book that I want to read through! Noah inspired me because he showed us a finding where he created a custom selenium script.
- Only issue I may run into is not focusing equal amounts of time to the goals I want to accomplish so I will work on a road map!
- *note to self, am I able to create a to-do tracker on github?*
