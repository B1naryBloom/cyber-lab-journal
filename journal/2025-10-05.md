<h1>What I've been up to: Recap of September, beginning of October</h1>
- Finally ran a demo of the web security academy api lab that I've been working on
- Created a Youtube channel that follows my journey of learning web security academy (though I need to do voiceovers for some of the work)
- Finally finished the Jr. Penetration Tester pathway on Try Hack Me! (While studying for everything else)
  - So now I'm able to gauge my skills and I realize that I need to work on my privilege escalation skills in both Windows and Linux
- Switching focus to eJPT studies, as well as CCNA here and there.
- Also going to learn more about metasploit, which was pretty awesome to use. 
- Wrote an article for the school that was published for the cybersecurity newsletter!
- Overall it's been great studying, I enjoy web security penetration testing. Looking forward to growing my skillset.
