# Cyber Journal Entry - August 5

- I got a chance to see what an API pentest looks like. Emily sent me a postman collection and guided me through the process
- This is right on time as I work through the Web Security Academy's API Learning Path, however I definitely understand that POSTMAN, and API's are going to be a big knowledge/skill gap for me. So I want to start prioritizing learning more about them.
- On the article she sent me to learn from, he talks about background knowledge being: OAuth, token structures like JWT and SAML, and a really good understanding of CORS(cross-origin resource sharing).
