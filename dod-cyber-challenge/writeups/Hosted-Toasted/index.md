Click on advanced and view certificate and look for anything that sticks
out:

I notice that it has two separate dns names registered. When you
originally visit the first website, you are met with this homepage: ![A

Going to the other website yields this page:\

After identifying the hidden internal domain from the SSL certificate,
we used dig to resolve the public-facing server's IP address. We then
mapped the internal domain to this IP in /etc/hosts to bypass DNS
restrictions and simulate access to an internal virtual host.

**üß† Final Write-Up Summary (Field-Tested for CTF Reports)**

**üîç Challenge Summary:**

The challenge hinted at a **hidden internal site** behind
https://not-torbian.ethtrader-ai.com/. Buried in the SSL certificate was
a suspicious alternate domain:

CopyEdit

definitelynotaflag.north.torbia

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Solution**

**‚úÖ Step 1: Discover the Hidden Domain**

By inspecting the SSL certificate (browser padlock \> certificate \>
SAN), we found:

plaintext

CopyEdit

DNS Name: definitelynotaflag.north.torbia

This domain didn't resolve publicly:

bash

CopyEdit

nslookup definitelynotaflag.north.torbia

Returned:

nginx

CopyEdit

NXDOMAIN

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**‚úÖ Step 2: Resolve the Public IP**

We extracted the **public IP address** of the main site with:

bash

CopyEdit

dig +short not-torbian.ethtrader-ai.com

It returned:

CopyEdit

34.86.60.228

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**‚úÖ Step 3: Host Override via /etc/hosts**

To "spoof" internal DNS resolution, we manually mapped the hidden domain
to the public IP:

bash

CopyEdit

sudo nano /etc/hosts

Added this line:

CopyEdit

34.86.60.228 definitelynotaflag.north.torbia

This tricks the system into thinking the internal name resolves
correctly --- perfect for CTFs and pentests where **host header
routing** is used.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**‚úÖ Step 4: Access the Internal Site**

We then made an HTTPS request directly:

bash

CopyEdit

curl -k https://definitelynotaflag.north.torbia/

Or visited it in-browser to view the content (TLS warning bypassed).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**üéØ Result:**

The internal site revealed the **flag** or another lead --- inaccessible
via normal DNS.

**üìù Final Notes (for write-up clarity)**

- This challenge demonstrates **host-based virtual routing**.

- It's often used in CTFs to simulate **segregated dev/internal
  infrastructure** that's not directly linked via DNS.

- Modifying /etc/hosts is a classic pentester move when probing SSL
  certs, Docker containers, or corporate web apps.

If you want, I can turn that into a markdown .md file or PDF export for
your report --- just say the word. üéØüíæ
